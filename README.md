# EasyCompress Interface
This repository contains the source code for the interface of EasyCompress, a tool that automates and intelligently compresses deep learning models.    

EasyCompress is designed to compress a model based on the degree of compression, the type of compression (model size, computations, or inference time), and a minimum required performance threshold.
It uses pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization techniques to achieve the desired compression configuration.

EasyCompress is available online [here](https://thesis.abelvansteenweghen.com).   
The repository containing the backend code of EasyCompress is available [here](https://github.com/abel-vs/thesis)
